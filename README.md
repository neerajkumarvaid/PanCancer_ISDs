# PanCancer_ISDs
This repository will contain code and data to reproduce the results of our work on pancancer survival prediction from whole transcriptome data. We will update this repository once the paper is accepted, meanwhile feel free to check the following repository for learning about individual survival distributions and various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of survival prediction models - https://github.com/haiderstats/ISDEvaluation
