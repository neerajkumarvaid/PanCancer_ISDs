# PanCancer_ISDs
This repository contains the code and data to reproduce the results of our work on pancancer survival prediction from whole transcriptome data. 

 **Folder** | **Description** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Code](https://github.com/neerajkumarvaid/PanCancer_ISDs/tree/main/Code) | Code to compute and analyze NMF of pancancer whole transcriptome data. |
| [ISDEvaluation](https://github.com/neerajkumarvaid/PanCancer_ISDs/tree/main/ISDEvaluation)| Code to compute and evaluate individual survival distributions, see instructions [here](https://github.com/haiderstats/ISDEvaluation)|
| [Reinforcement_Learning](https://github.com/neerajkumarvaid/ML_DL_RL_Codes/tree/master/Reinforcement_Learning) | Python implementations of the algorithms discussed Udemy's course [Artificial Intelligence: Reinforcement Learning in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-reinforcement-learning-in-python/).  |


We will update this repository once the paper is accepted, meanwhile feel free to check the following repository for learning about individual survival distributions and various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of survival prediction models - https://github.com/haiderstats/ISDEvaluation
